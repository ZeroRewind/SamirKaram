        <p>The story of how I became a fantasy writer is probably something you've heard before— or even experienced yourself!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I grew up on games and anime, slowly learning to appreciate the value of a good story. I started with simple RPGs, as they had the most story compared to shooters and the like. As the gaming industry continued to progress, I began
          noticing a higher amount of story-driven videogames such as 'The Last Of Us', 'Mass Effect' and many others.<p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>All the while, I delved into the world of fanfiction for all of my favorite games and anime, which eventually led me to gain an appreciation for the written word and its tremendous potential. And so, I took the next natural step and
            dove headlong into many fantasy novels, going on epic adventures and experiencing all emotions under the sun.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Most importantly, I knew that this was what I truly loved.</p>
          <br>
          <p>And so, here I am, making my contribution to this remarkable society. I am glad to share my stories with you all and I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed writing them.</p>

          <p>Being dragged into a world of magic sounds like fun— until you're actually there.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Instead, Nevan has to fight for his survival in a world of monsters, blood sacrifice and death, as well as maintain his sanity when the voices of the souls he'd consumed begin to speak to him.</p>

      <h1><u>It isn't just about the spelling.</u></h1>
      <div class="lifestory">
        <p>Of course, never let it be said that spelling isn't important, but it is only a small slice of the pie that is editing!</p>
        <p>So, what else is left in the editing process, you may wonder?</p>
        <p>I'm glad you asked. Here are some aspects of writing I give special attention to when editing your precious work:</p>
        <br>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 border-line">
            <h2><u>Vocabulary</u></h2>
            <p>Your spelling may be impeccable, but if your vocabulary is not up to par, you end up using the same words, over and over!</p>
            <p>Example: "He coldly replied, giving his brother a cold look."</p>
            <p>The error here is the repetition of the word "cold".</p>
            <p>Edited: "He coldly replied, giving his brother a frigid look."</p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 border-line">
            <h2><u>Punctuation</u></h2>
            <p>Where you punctuate can make a huge difference. I believe the most famous example is:</p>
            <p>"Let's eat, Grandpa!" vs. "Let's eat Grandpa!"</p>
            <p>As you can see, a single mistake can show the difference between having dinner with a grandparent, and eating said grandparent.</p>
            <p>Note: please don't ever eat Grandpa. He's nice.</p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-12 border-line">
            <h2><u>Narrative Flow</u></h2>
            <p>This is the big one. Narrative flow can make or break your story.</p>
            <p>The biggest truth in writing is summed up in this quote: "An idea is only as good as its execution."</p>
            <p>You might have created an epic tale, but if its flow is stunted, it can spell doom for your book!</p>
            <p>What do I mean by this?</p>
            <p>Your story has a rhythm to it. You set the pace, and the reader unconsciously matches your pace. So, what happens if this pace is broken?</p>
            <p>Here's a simple example:</p>
            <p>"Brendan swerved his bike to the left at the last minute, narrowly escaping death by truck."</p>
            <p>As you can tell, the intent of this line is to make the reader feel as if Brendan was lucky to survive. The problem, however, is the use of "the last minute".</p>
            <p>A minute is sixty seconds, of course. So, while the reader understands the intent, the narrative flow is nonetheless broken. In turn, this breaks immersion, which can doom your book's chances.</p>
            <p>Simply switching "minute" with "second" would have averted disaster.</p>
          </div>

        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Point is:</u></h2>
        <p>These are only some of the aspects I thoroughly critique when combing through a manuscript. I have a good eye when it comes to this sort of thing.</p>
        <p>I can't tell you how many good, self-published stories that I've read broke my immersion through mistakes in flow, vocabulary, punctuation, or even spelling!</p>
        <p>Speaking as an author, I find myself getting swept up in my own world and forget to edit properly. I call it "Author's Curse". The Curse can only be lifted by an editor in the light of the full Moon.</p>
        <p>Minus the Moon.</p>

      <h1><u>Packages</u></h1>
      <p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> A low-level edit, where I only focus on the basics. I locate and correct— or highlight, depending on your preference— spelling, grammar and punctuation errors.</p>
      <p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> The recommended option. On top of correcting grammar, punctuation and spelling, I will find and fix all errors which break narrative flow. These errors include awkward phrases, plot holes, and words that just don't
        seem to fit your story.</p>
      <br>
      <h2><u>Rates</u></h2>
      <p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> $0.005 per word.</p>
      <p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> $0.0035 per word.</p>
      <h6>Minimum charge for "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" is $10.</h6>
      <h6>Currency is in U.S. Dollars</h6>

      <h1><u>Free Sample</u></h1>
      <p>As a gesture of goodwill, I will proofread a small section of your story: a chapter or a sample of around 4000 words for free.</p>
      <p>If you find the results of the editing to your liking, then we can discuss sending the rest for either a basic "Tier 1" edit or the more complete "Tier 2" edit.</p>
      <p>I accept payment through PayPal, though you do not require a PayPal account for us to do business.</p>

         Simply ask for a free proofreading sample, and send the sample in question.
